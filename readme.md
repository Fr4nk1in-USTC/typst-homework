# Typst Homework

A simple template for homeworks in [Typst](https://typst.app).

You might want to install the Fandol font in ttf **systemwide** for better
experience in Chinese mode.
Fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/Fr4nk1in-USTC/fandol-ttf).

If you don't need to turn Chinese mode on, just modify the first line of the
template file (both 2 `homework.typ`) into

```rust
#let chinese = false
```
